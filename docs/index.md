# Keystone Technical Documentation

Keystone is a web-based resource allocation system for high-performance computing (HPC) systems.
It provides a centralized interface for managing HPC allocations across large user groups and diverse computational environments.

Application features include:

- Streamlined allocation workflows for HPC resources across one or more clusters
- The automatic enforcement of resource limits in Slurm job submissions
- Tracking for user research products, including grants and publications
- User account management via teams and RBAC permissions
- Automated user notifications for system changes and events
- Robust operational support via metrics and logging

This documentation is intended for developers and technical personnel who contribute to the Keystone software.
First time contributors are encouraged to reference the application [architecture diagrams](architecture.md).
