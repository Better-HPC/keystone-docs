# Keystone Documentation

Keystone is an integrated management platform that streamlines governance for high-performance computing (HPC) systems.
It offers administrators a centralized interface for allocating resources, monitoring system utilization, and tracking
research productivity across clusters. For researchers and end users, it provides self-service workflows that reduce
wait times and administrative bottlenecks.

This documentation is intended for system administrators and technical stakeholders involved in the Keystone project.
It provides detailed, production-focused guidance for deploying and operating Keystone in enterprise HPC environments.
