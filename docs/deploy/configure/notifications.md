# Notification Templates

Keystone issues automated notifications alerting users to system changes and platform events.
Administrators can customize these notifications using templates to reflect organization-specific branding and
messaging.

## Overriding Templates

Keystone renders HTML notifications using the Jinja2 templating engine.
The location of custom templates is configurable via [application settings](api_settings.md).

When a notification is triggered, Keystone first checks for a custom template file.
If no custom template is available, Keystone falls back to an internal default.
The selected template is then rendered using the context data outlined below.

Email notification templates can be rendered and written to disk using the `keystone-api render_templates` command.
It is strongly recommended to develop and test templates locally before deploying them to a production environment.
See `keystone-api render_templates --help` for details.

### Template Security

Template files are required to have no write permissions for users other than the owner or group (i.e., `o+w`).
If a template file has world-writeable permissions, Keystone will refuse to load it.
This restriction is provided for security and ensures templates cannot be modified by unauthorized users in production.

Notification templates are automatically sanitized to remove any JavaScript or externally loaded resources (e.g. CSS imports).
Users familiar with the Jinja2 templating engine will also find certain Jinja features are not available, including
access to application internals and the ability to bypass variable sanitation.

## Templates

The following templates are available for customization.

### Base Template

**Template file:** `base.html`

The base template serves as the parent layout for all notification content, providing top-level styling and structure.
The template defines two content blocks that child templates override to inject content.

    | `main`     | Main body content of the email notification.           |
    | `footer`   | Footer content displayed at the bottom of the message. |
