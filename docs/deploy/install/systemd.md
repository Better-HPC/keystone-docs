# Deploying with Systemd

The Keystone API can be installed directly onto a machine using system packages.
Doing so requires administrative privileges and assumes you are familiar with managing system services via systemd.

## Installing the API

The `keystone_api` package can be installed using the `pipx` package manager.

```bash
BHPC_REPO="https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/better-hpc/keystone/python/simple/"
pipx install --extra-index-url=$BHPC_REPO --include-deps keystone-api
```

If leveraging LDAP for user authentication, include the LDAP dependency group in the `install` command.
This option requires the LDAP libraries and development headers to be pre-installed on the host system.

```bash
pipx install --extra-index-url=$BHPC_REPO --include-deps keystone-api[ldap]
```

If the installation was successful, the packaged CLI tool will be available in your working environment.
Use the `--help` option to view the available commands.

```bash
keystone-api --help
```

The `keystone-api` utility does not support tab autocompletion by default.
To enable autocomplete for the Bash or Zsh shells use the `enable_autocomplete` command.

```bash
keystone-api enable_autocomplete
```

## Deploying Dependencies

Keystone-API requires several backend services to support its operation.
Specific instructions are provided below on configuring each dependency.

### Redis

Most Redis server instances will work out of the box so long as the connection and authentication values are set
correctly in the API settings.

### SMTP

The API requires an SMTP server to issue user notifications. No specific requirements are imposed on the server itself,
only that the connection and authentication values are set correctly in the API settings.

### PostgreSQL

After deploying a PostgreSQL instance, you will need to create a dedicated database and user account.
Start by launching a new SQL session with admin permissions.

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Next, create a database and a service account.
Make sure to replace the password field with a secure value.

```postgresql
create database keystone;
create user keystone_service with encrypted password '[PASSWORD]';
grant all privileges on database keystone to keystone_service;
```

### Celery

Both Celery and Celery Beat are included when installing the `keystone_api` package.
Both applications should be launched using `keystone_api.apps.scheduler` as the target application.

```bash
celery -A keystone_api.apps.scheduler worker
celery -A keystone_api.apps.scheduler beat --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler
```

The `celery` command executes as a foreground process by default.
The following unit files are provided as a starting point to daemonize the process via the systemd service manager.

!!! warning

    Celery can generate a significant number of log files, particularly when running multiple concurrent workers.
    Administrators should regularly rotate and clear log files to prevent excessive disk consumption.

=== "keystone-worker.service"

    ```toml
    [Unit]
    Description=Celery workers for Keystone
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=forking
    User=keystone
    Group=keystone
    RuntimeDirectory=celery
    WorkingDirectory=/home/keystone
    EnvironmentFile=/home/keystone/keystone.env
    ExecStart=/bin/sh -c '/home/keystone/.local/bin/celery multi start w1 -A keystone_api.apps.scheduler'
    ExecStop=/bin/sh -c '/home/keystone/.local/bin/celery multi stopwait w1'
    ExecReload=/bin/sh -c '/home/keystone/.local/bin/celery multi restart w1'

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

=== "keystone-beat.service"

    ```toml
    [Unit]
    Description=Celery Beat scheduler for keystone
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    User=keystone
    Group=keystone
    RuntimeDirectory=beat
    WorkingDirectory=/home/keystone
    EnvironmentFile=/home/keystone/keystone.env
    ExecStart=/bin/sh -c '/home/keystone/.local/bin/celery -A keystone_api.apps.scheduler beat --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler'
    Restart=always

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

## Deploying the Application

Before launching the API, migrate the database to the latest schema version and collect any static files.
See the [Settings](../configure/api_settings.md) page for details on configuring database credentials and the static
files location.

```bash
keystone-api migrate
keystone-api collectstatic
```

Uvicorn is the recommended web server for running the Keystone-API.
When launching the web server, use the ASGI entrypoint located under `keystone_api.main.asgi:application`.

```bash
uvicorn --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 keystone_api.main.asgi:application
```

The `uvicorn` command executes as a foreground process by default.
The unit file below is provided as a starting point to daemonize the process via the systemd service manager.
It defines the `keystone-server` service referenced throughout this documentation.

=== "keystone-server.service"

    ```toml
    [Unit]
    Description=Webserver daemon for Keystone
    After=network.target

    [Service] # (1)!
    Type=simple
    User=keystone
    Group=keystone
    RuntimeDirectory=uvicorn
    WorkingDirectory=/home/keystone
    EnvironmentFile=/home/keystone/keystone.env
    ExecStart=/home/keystone/.local/bin/uvicorn keystone_api.main.asgi:application --uds /run/uvicorn/keystone.sock
    ExecReload=/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID
    KillMode=mixed
    TimeoutStopSec=5
    PrivateTmp=true

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    1. The sock directory must exist and be owned by the user/group specified in the systemd configuration.

## Configuring the Proxy

Using a web proxy in front of the API server is recommended for improved load balancing and security.
A starter Nginx configuration file is provided below for convenience.
Special attention is called to the `Host` header which is required by the backend API. 

```nginx
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;

    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/pki/tls/certs/keystone.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/pki/tls/private/keystone.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://unix:/run/uvicorn/keystone.sock;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host; # Required by the API
    }

    location /media/ { # (1)!
        alias /var/keystone-api/upload_files/;
    }
}
```

1. The aliased directory is used to host user-provided files and should match the `CONFIG_UPLOAD_DIR` in application
   settings.
   Don't forget the trailing slash when specifying file paths via the `alias` directive.
